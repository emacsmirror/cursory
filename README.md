# Cursory for GNU Emacs

Cursory lets users define preset configurations for the cursor. Those
cover the style of the cursor (e.g. box or bar), whether it is
blinking or not, and how fast, as well as the colour it uses. Having
distinct presets makes it easy to switch between, say, a "reading
mode" with an ambient cursor and a "presentation mode" with a cursor
that is more noticeable and thus easier to spot.
